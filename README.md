# Demo Application

This is a simple Demo-Application to show how several units can be connected via Linked-Units feature.
In this example there are four units
- Drilling station
- Assembly station
- Quality Inspection
- Transport

Transport is meant to be some kind of general manager of those other stations and as direct access to its child-unit-interfaces.
Therefore, if you want to Home the whole machine, just start homing of the Transport which takes care of homing its child-units.

If there are any questions, feel free to contact for more information.
